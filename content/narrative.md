# Sustainable Agriculture, Sustainable Lives

## Enabling Women's Financial Independence in Western Kenya

Kagure, a 9 year old Luo girl in Western Province, Kenya, already feels the weight of a paternalistic society on her shoulders. She wakes early to help her mother feed her siblings, the chickens, and the family cow. During the past decade, children in Kagure’s position have gained access to free elementary education, so after her demanding morning ritual, as her mother heads for the rainforest to scavenge for firewood, Kagure sets off on the dirt path to her local school.  It provides a basic education in math and english, though her labor is also employed here to work her school’s 1 acre farm.  It is hard work, but knowledge of subsistence agriculture aids her in improving the yields of beans, kale, corn, yams, and lentils that her family relies on to sustain themselves.

However, the prized cow her family owns produces only 1/2 quart of milk per day in a culture where it is a luxury in high demand.  If her school provided lessons in Improved dairy management, she could activate that resource to fund a path to a higher education.

In 2006, President Barack Obama visited his grandmother in a village a stone’s throw from Kagure’s home.  Shortly after, he was elected into office.  Kagure was not yet born to witness it.

She deserves the chance to see the change he promised and demonstrated to the world. 

At the average Kenyan wage, a $25 pair of shoes takes a week to earn. Donate your old smartphone and Sawa will give the proceeds of its sale in Kenya to Kargure’s elementary school to fund its improved dairy farming and conservation agriculture program. 

You can help her leverage her resources to change her life.
